Yesterday, here in the UK, we had Local Elections. Not all the results are in, but it appears that the [Labour Party](https://www.labour.org.uk/) (who's web-site appears to be broken at time of writing) has taken a complete bashing with [the England share of votes predicted to come out at 27%](https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/local_councils/html/region_99999.stm). This is only 1% higher than their all-time low of 26%.

While turnout was fairly good in Scotland and Wales, the English voters seemed just as apathetic as usual. It's understandable, really, though, as when I went out and voted at about 13:30 yesterday afternoon, I was quite surprised to note that in my ward there were in fact three candidates. One of whom I'd never even heard of. I really don't understand how any of the candidates expected me to know for whom to vote, as the only campaigning I noticed was a leaflet through my door about 3 weeks ago from the [Conservative Party](https://www.conservatives.com/), and another leaflet from the Labour Party a week before that. So, as you can imagine, finding out that the [Liberal Democrat Party](https://www.libdems.org.uk/) had a candidate in my area was quite a shock.

The campaigning in the whole of my local council's borough was based around the proposed Manydown development. This is a few large fields to the west of Basingstoke that someone at some point thought was a good idea to develop. However, all the main parties have been saying that, if elected into power, they would bin the plans.

The residents of Winklebury, the closest part of Basingstoke to the Manydown site, have set up a web-site for the [Save Manydown Campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/20170524192119/http://savemanydown.org.uk/), and all the local election candidates picked up on the feeling that the Greenfield site should not be developed under the current plans. Personally, I don't mind the Manydown development, as long as the kinks are ironed out of the plans before committing. The main detractions, so far, that have brought the process to a halt are: Traffic, Sewerage, Travel and public bus services, and Timing.

So, how did my local council fare in the elections? Well, the Conservatives retained control of the council with no changes in the number of seats each party holds. So, that's a bit of a damp squid: absolutely no changes in the power distribution whatsoever. Detailed information about these results can be found at [the BBC Election 2007 Web-site](https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/councils/html/24ub.stm).
