It's friday, and I'm awake late into the night again; ho hum. But anyway, I was just wondering why anybody would want a [Fleshlight "Succu Dry" male sex toy](https://www.fleshlight.com/products/vampire-succu-dry). Is it just me, or does the idea of putting your dinky winky someplace that has teeth kind of not sound very safe? I'm sure there are some men that would get a thrill out of the idea of vampyric oral sex, but for me I much prefer the whole biting of the neck than the widdly weewee.

## Bootnote:

Just FYI, I **can** say words like penis and such, but I felt the need to make the post sound more childish. Oh, and don't ask how I came across the site!
